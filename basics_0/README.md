# Holberton School Network Basics - Project Basic_0

## Description

This project is a part of the Holberton School curriculum focusing on network basics. It covers fundamental concepts such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, and network troubleshooting using ICMP.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, students are expected to:

- Understand the OSI model and its layers.
- Differentiate between LAN and WAN networks and their typical usage.
- Comprehend the role of IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6.
- Recognize the differences between TCP and UDP protocols.
- Learn about TCP/UDP ports and their significance.
- Acquire basic network troubleshooting skills using ICMP with the `ping` command.
